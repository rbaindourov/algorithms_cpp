What Is Engrish? Mixed Syntax
Each line can be valid Python or an English-like pseudocode command.

Natural Parse Trees
“English-like” lines follow intuitive grammatical structures (verbs, noun phrases, etc.) but must be converted into Python through a PST-based approach.

Parse Summary Tree (PST) Rules
One Word = One Node
Each word in the line is represented as a single node.

Summary at Each Node
Each node itself acts as a “summary” of its subtree (i.e., it is the key word in that subtree).

Specificity Increases with Depth
More specialized terms appear lower in the tree, often reversing the typical English word order in noun phrases.

Example
Consider the line:

translate Engrish code X into python

A simplified PST might look like this:

         translate

         /         \

     code           into

    /    \          /

Engrish   X      python


The top node is the verb translate.

It has two children: the noun phrase code Engrish X (summarized as code) and the prepositional phrase into python.

Noun Phrase Example: For the phrase pyngrish function definition, you would build the PST as follows:

definition

   function

      pyngrish

definition is the most general term.

function is a subtype, and pyngrish is even more specific.

In English word order, we might say “pyngrish function definition,” but in the PST, the hierarchy is reversed to place the more general term at the top.

Your Task:
Implement a function that, given a single line of Engrish pseudocode, constructs its Parse Summary Tree according to the rules above. Each node should capture the most general term at the current level, with more specific modifiers as children.

Key Points to Consider:

Identifying the Verb: In many Engrish lines, the top-level node will be the main verb.

Grouping Child Phrases: Determine how to split out noun phrases, prepositional phrases, etc.

Handling Modifiers: Reversing the order of adjectives or specialized terms so that the more general concept is the parent node.

Examples: Basic Verb + Noun

Input:

create variable X

PST:

create

  variable

    X

More Complex Noun Phrase

Input:

compile advanced Engrish module M into python

Possible PST (one of many valid forms):

           compile

           /      \

       module     into

      /      \     /

    Engrish   M  python 

   / 

advanced

(Note: The exact tree shape may vary, but must follow the rules.)

Compound Noun

Input:

test new Engrish function F

PST:

test

  function

    Engrish

      new

    F

(Again, exact tree shapes may differ slightly based on your parsing logic, but they must follow the general principles.)



Thought for

Expand for details
To address the user's query, I will implement a function that constructs a Parse Summary Tree (PST) for a given line of Engrish pseudocode, following the specified rules: each word becomes a node, each node summarizes its subtree, and specificity increases with depth, often reversing typical English word order in noun phrases. Below, I’ll define the solution step-by-step, provide the implementation, and explain how it handles the examples.

Solution Approach
The Engrish pseudocode is a mix of English-like commands and Python syntax, typically structured as a verb followed by a noun phrase and optionally a prepositional phrase (e.g., "into python"). The PST must reflect grammatical relationships, with the main verb as the root, and child nodes representing phrases like noun phrases and prepositional phrases, where noun phrases have their head noun as the parent and modifiers as children in a specific hierarchy.

Key Steps:
Tokenize the Input: Split the input line into individual words.
Identify the Verb: The first word is typically the main verb, forming the root of the PST.
Split into Phrases: Check for a preposition like "into" to separate the noun phrase (before "into") and the prepositional phrase (after "into"). If "into" is absent, the remaining words form the noun phrase.
Build the Noun Phrase Subtree:
Head Noun: If the last word is a single uppercase letter (e.g., "X", "M"), it’s an identifier, and the head is the second-to-last word; otherwise, the head is the last word.
Modifiers: Words before the head are modifiers, nested as a chain where each modifier modifies the next, attached in reverse order (e.g., head → modifier_n → ... → modifier_1).
Identifier: If present, attached directly to the head.
Build the Prepositional Phrase Subtree: If "into" exists, it becomes a node with the following word (e.g., "python") as its child.
Construct the PST: Attach the noun phrase’s head and the prepositional phrase’s head (if present) as direct children of the verb.
Node Representation:
We’ll use a simple Node class with a value (the word) and a list of children.

How It Works with Examples
Let’s verify the implementation against the provided examples.

Example 1: translate Engrish code X into python
Words: ["translate", "Engrish", "code", "X", "into", "python"]
Verb: "translate" (root)
Split:
Noun phrase: ["Engrish", "code", "X"]
Prepositional phrase: ["into", "python"]
Noun Phrase:
Last word "X" is a single capital letter → identifier = "X", head = "code"
Modifiers: ["Engrish"]
Subtree: "code" → "Engrish", "code" → "X"
Prepositional Phrase:
Subtree: "into" → "python"

Explanation of Rules Compliance
One Word = One Node: Each word in the input becomes a distinct node in the tree.
Summary at Each Node: Each node represents the key word of its subtree (e.g., "code" summarizes "Engrish code X").
Specificity Increases with Depth: In noun phrases, the head noun (most general) is the parent, with modifiers (more specific) as children, nested such that earlier modifiers are deeper (e.g., "function" → "Engrish" → "new").
The implementation assumes a simple grammar: a verb followed by a noun phrase, optionally followed by "into" and an object. It identifies the head noun and nests modifiers in a chain, reversing their order to place the most general term higher, aligning with the PST’s specificity rule.

This solution provides a complete, working implementation that constructs the PST for the given Engrish pseudocode lines, adhering to the specified rules and matching the example structures.
